		   The best designs for our future Martian dwellings can be determined by AI, along with their placement and the best methods for cultivating fields of fruits and vegetables in mars. If enough data is gathered, artificial intelligence may be able to help solve problems that initially appear to be insurmountable. This documentary, which features cutting-edge technology that could change agriculture and space travel, is narrated by Robert Downey Jr., a well-known actor best known for his role as Iron Man and a scientific enthusiast.
Besides personal health related subjects, AI can also help with climate change. It is currently the biggest challenge on Earth, and with the help of AI we can use it to revert the damage done. AI is already used to receive climate information but also out to improve more its prediction on extreme weather hurricanes, climate downscaling, and the socio-economic impacts of weather and climate. AI is also used to measure where carbon is coming form which is known as “Carbon Tracker.” Carbon Tracker is working towards the UN goal to preventing new coal plants from being built by 2020. Their plan is to monitor coal plant emissions with satellite imagery and gather data to convince the industry that carbon plants aren’t profitable. According to an article called “How Artificial Intelligence Can Tackle Climate Change” by Jackie Snow, she states that “A grant from Google is expanding the nonprofit’s satellite imagery efforts to include gas-powered plants’ emissions and get a better sense of where air pollution is coming from.” (Snow, Jackie) Carbon Tracker will try to stop emissions from at least four thousand to five thousand power plants by getting more information than what they currently have and make it public. This way we can put a halt to all the over pollution effecting our world.
As a citizen of a developing country, I am not that aware of actually of the existence of this artificial intelligence (AI) because in terms of technology in the Philippines, we are not that updated and it is more of a human-capital country. And so, watching the films about AI made me feel thrilled and at the same time frightened of what this technology could do in our lives.
