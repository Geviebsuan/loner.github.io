			I just finished a really fascinating video.
			It is a visualization of how far artificial intelligence, 
			or the Age of AI, has come through YouTube originals. 
			The speaker extolled the virtues of artificial intelligence to the audience. 
			The speaker explained the context of AI as well as how fantastic it can be.
			A.I. is a subject that Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., addresses in this video. 
			(Artificial Intelligence), which also includes Mark Sagar and Will.I.Am. 
			This film will introduce us to two different visionaries as they talk about identity, creativity, and human-machine collaboration. 
			It takes less time for technology to become widely used because it is developing more swiftly than ever. 
			It took roughly 10,000 years from the invention of writing to the printing press, yet just 500 years for e-mail to be developed. 
			It seems as though a new era is beginning. 
			Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science, focuses on simulating intelligent behavior in machines.
			AI is teaching the machine, which increases its intelligence. 
			Intelligence is now found in a variety of species, unlike the past when it was exclusively seen in humans. 
			We don't program the machines. They grow as individuals.
			Mark Sagar invented Baby X. Baby X is a lifelike replica of a child that has a microphone for hearing and a webcam for viewing.
			That is an illustration of some AI.
			As the study of robotics became more and more important, scientists started to examine, track, create, 
			and work on this digital reproduction of oneself that was human-like. 
			Artificial intelligence, or AI, was created, and several advancements and breakthroughs were made to help people in different ways.
			Algorithms, big data, computer vision, and machine learning have all become trendy buzzwords.
			AI made it possible for machines to learn and grow intelligent.
			Machine simulations with intelligence were employed. Machines and people may now collaborate thanks to AI.
