		   With the rapid advancement of technology, more and more cognitive tasks and jobs that were previously thought to be reserved for people are now being performed by computers. With robots, people can communicate effectively. Our ability to drive and prepare food will both benefit from AI.
According to one of the engineers that make the automated driving trail truck which is the automated driving t-line, they enhances this kind of technology to have less incidents within the road. In order to have a successful AI technology it runs a test drive with a test driver who has been driving a trail truck all over the years. She said that they are both learning both the driver and the automated trail truck. The trail truck has a 360 degrees camera that is installed with it. As well as sensors that detects the speed of the cars in front it. Although it is equip with a high technology it has no common sense that humans had. It still needs to learn along with the drivers. AI technology still needs the human in order gain more knowledge and experience. Just like the food service of pizza it has an AI technology or machine that helps shape the dough of the pizza and put sauce and cook it. The oven that is used in cooking the pizza is an AI machine that has the timer on how much time will it cook as well as its temperature. Also they used, radar that will survey on how many people will eat that kind of pizza on what flavor will they order. So, they will be manufactured ahead of time. This kind of method will make their work easier and faster with the help of the machine.
The future work is evolving. Automations making workplace safer, greener and more efficient. It’s more about what we’re gaining than what we’re losing. If we configure out how to integrate AI technology, not to replace humans, but to augment their abilities, to make life more fun, make us more productive and more creative. That’s will the power of machine will come.
