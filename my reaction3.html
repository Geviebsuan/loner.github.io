		   Using A.I. to build a better human is a great documentary. Through life changing accidents, and data minded through NASCAR, human beings are finding ways to rebuild one another so that we are better, faster, and stronger than ever before and all with the help of A.I. Once nothing more than the stuff of comic books and TV shows, we truly have the technology to become modern superheroes. The Age of A.I. A great documentary on how far AI has come and what how far AI can go.
This video goes from AI applied to translation or voice recognition, to higher manufacturing automation, to facial recognition or even to analysis and behavioral prediction in the LegalTech, fintech, MedTech and other areas. The truth is AI can aid humans to become a better version of themselves. However, if old habits die hard, old assumptions die harder: changing our behavior and creating new habits is not easy - however clear the benefits may be. Freeing ourselves from sci-fi assumptions is not any easier. The truth is we need AI to help us become healthier, more productive humans capable of making better decisions with more information and more data. Most true AI offers feedback loops to customize use.
Therefore, AI would be a positive factor in business because of the rapid changes that is happening in the technological world. There would be less reliance on human decisions, fewer forecasting errors and objectivity of decisions that will result in an improved ability to predict and respond to customer and client needs. So, it means that AI will not totally replace the roles of the managers in terms of decision making and planning but it would help them ease or revolutionize their work.
