		   Many say that human beings have destroyed our planet. Because of this these people are endeavoring to save it through the help of artificial intelligence. Famine, animal extinction, and war may all be preventable one day with the help of technology. Artificial Intelligence has changed our world. AI has gone from a science-fiction dream to a critical part of our everyday lives. In the future, these robots could help humans at work and in daily living, performing tasks that are dangerous for humans and assisting in medicine, caregiving, security, building and industry.
AI has many advantages: reduction in human error, risk-taking in place of humans, 24/7 availability, help in repetitive jobs, digital assistance and faster decision-taking. AI would have a lower error rate than humans. It would have incredible precision, accuracy and speed, and would not be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space and endure problems that would injure or kill people. 
AI saves endangered species and forests Systems using artificial intelligence can evaluate large amounts of data which of use to environmentalists. AI is already being used to monitor endangered species and observe forests. Five ways AI is saving wildlife â€“ from counting chimps to locating whales: Stopping poachers, tracking water loss, finding whales, protecting koalas, and Counting species.
