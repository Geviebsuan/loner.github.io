			AI is our most powerful technology, and in the next few decades it will change everything about the nature of being human. Understanding what it is, how it works, and something about its promise and its peril will increasingly be basic literacy for citizens. This is a well-made, well-informed show that will get many more people up to speed, and that is greatly to be welcomed.
The second episode addresses how AI is advancing medical science, and also disseminating it, making it more widely available in the developing world, for instance. It rams home the point that the availability of masses of data is what enables machines to diagnose illnesses faster and more cheaply than human doctors can. Healed through AI is a great documentary. The human body is not infallible, but through the wonders of A.I. research scientists are finding ways to address those imperfections. A.I. has the potential to heal, enhance and make up for the things our bodies lack which can be healed through AI.
The second film, it was concentrated on the use or advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) in the business world. It compares the new economy versus the old one, stating that for survival a business should have a strong brand, innovative and as much as possible has a service that would connect to humans. And in order to thrive in this competitive world, a business needs to change its model through working together with AI. It concluded that the future of business is that anything that is a process can and will be run by an AI because its promise is making experiences executable. Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the business model. It would soon replace services provided by businesses but never the human brain because AI has limitations. Its main goal is not to replace humans but to work together with them. It is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. And so, artificial intelligence and businesses should go together because we need money and people. Regardless of whether todayâ€™s businesses are ready, AI will be here soon and it will transform everything.
