		   A.I. is searching for alien life forms. We now have the technology to help find an answer to the question of whether there are other intelligent species in this galaxy. Scientists are once more looking for extraterrestrial life as a result of the development of artificial intelligence, but they are also beginning to wonder if a brand-new life form has appeared on earth.
The focus of this documentary is using artificial intelligence to look for alien life in space. The SETI Institute, also known as Searching for Extraterrestrial Life, is one example of a facility that looks for extraterrestrial species. The SETI Institute is an organization that searches for extraterrestrial life. It has the Arren Telescope Array, which uses artificial intelligence to look for extraterrestrial life. They will be able to better analyze the large amount of data flowing from space thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models and systems. While some are intensifying their hunt in space, others are employing artificial intelligence to delve deeper into the inner life. A business called Sanctuary AI works with robots that resemble humans. They create a robot with a sense of humor and the ability to respond to human touch. a question-and-answer machine They use a sensor that is placed in the robot's hands to detect human contact. They also incorporate a camera that can detect human gestures and faces. 
Similar to how every significant advancement in technology creates a new type of civilization with new moral standards, so too will artificial intelligence. Undoubtedly, technology is altering us. The entire concept of what it means to be human is changing. AI may be the most important tool humanity has, but it is still only a tool.
