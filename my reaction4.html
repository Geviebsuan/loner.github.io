		   Love, art and stories: decoded. Humans have theorized, debated, and argued over these questions for centuries. As researchers become closer and closer to boiling these concepts down to a science, A.I. projects become closer to becoming alternatives for romantic companions and artists in their own right. The Age of A.I. is an 8-part documentary series hosted by Robert Downey Jr. covering the ways Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Neural Networks will change the world.
The episode follows the story of Bafta-nominated film director Oscar Sharp and tech artist Ross Goodwin attempting to create a coherent movie from a script written entirely by an A.I. algorithm. Artificial intelligence now makes possible the advent of self-driving cars, and robots that can exhibit empathy and communicate affectionately with their users. The documentary aims to show that, rather than a competitor, A.I. can be viewed as a collaborator capable of empowering us to produce creative work at previously inaccessible levels.
What I personally think about AI is that, AI there is neither good or evil, it is just more on how it’s used and implemented. People are just projecting their own misuse onto the technology. On some circumstances AI can really be beneficial such as cancer detection, helping those with diseases, or even making a difference on climate change. There are many visible ways in which AI is influencing, changing and shaping our world. I would agree that we should be able to use AI as a helping matter and use it beneficial tool. But yes, there is conflict with AI and AI can be a threat on human freedom, privacy, and to certain jobs. For an example President XI From what I’ve seen and read President XI doesn’t let other citizens voice their opinion on government. I believe people should voice their opinion on what they believe in whether if they’re agreeing or disagreeing and not punish them for doing so. Things like this show what AI can be, in the wrong hands. Although I do believe that AI is beneficial, I do believe it can be equally harmful. There is a middle ground to find and I hope for our future generations can find this middle ground and keep it running the way it should forever.
